# bootcamp-course-notes
While enrolled in a full stack web development and software engineering bootcamp, I realised that my notes are much more valuable when collated into a website. This website showcases the skills I've learnt while also allowing me to easily revisit topics and concepts I learnt early in my bootcamp experience. I hope this repository helps you too!

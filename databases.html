        <h3>Data and Information</h3>
        <p>
          Data is a collection of inputs that have not been cleaned, organised
          or analysed. Unlike data, information has been processed and
          formatted. Information is data that has been processed in this way
          allowing the user to understand its meaning and glean useful knowledge
          about trends and other patterns and relationships from the cleaned and
          formatted data.

          This table illustrates an example of records within a database file.
          Each row represents a unique record, comprising multiple fields that
          describe a single entity, in this case, a customer. The headers
          (Customer ID, Name, Email, Phone Number, Address) define each field,
          showing the kind of data contained in each. This structured format of
          data collection helps in organising and managing information
          effectively. The table itself symbolises a file, an aggregation of
          related records.

          Using Database Management System (DBMS) to Solve Data Management
          Issues
        </h3>
        <article id="efficient-data-retrieval">
          <h4>Efficient Data Retrieval</h4>
          <p>
            Before the introduction of DBMS, retrieving a record was
            time-consuming as one would often have to manually find the file and
            relevant record in physical storage or in local storage. If the data
            was to be used in a program one would need to write code
            specifically for data retrieval. The speed of data retrieval is more
            efficient with DBMS. For example, search engines use DBMS to
            retrieve data that matches a user search query from billions of
            records stored remotely and retrieved in real time.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article id="data-consolidation">
          <h4>Data Consolidation and Consistency</h4>
          <p>
            Because data was not stored in centralised databases,
            inconsistencies, redundancies, and duplicates were common in data
            before DBMS. Without centralised repositories different users may
            add the same record into locally stored versions of the file. A
            single organisation could have multiple versions of a file being
            used by multiple departments making operational errors more common.
            DBMS resolved this issue by allowing multiple users to access the
            same data with consolidation occurring in real time.

        <article id="backups-recovery">
          <h4>Data Backups and Recovery</h4>
          <p>
            Before DBMS, data would have been backed up manually from local
            storage to external storage. Backups were time-consuming and the
            more files that exist, the longer the backup process would take and
            more storage capacity would be required whether this be in hard
            drives or in physical folders in a storage facility. Data backups
            would need to be consolidated manually removing redundant data that
            has not changed since the last backup.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article id="data-security">
          <h4>Data Security and Integrity</h4>
          <p>
            Without DBMS managing the integrity of data is difficult. The
            addition of incomplete or unreliable data could go unnoticed
            affecting the quality of observations within the dataset. When using
            DBMS, rules can be used to trigger alerts providing protection to
            data.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article id="data-storage">
          <h4>Data Storage</h4>
          <p>
            Without DBMS, storing data requires digital or physical capacity
            resulting in scalability issues when datasets grow. Storing backups
            exacerbates data storage issues and any risks associated with data
            storage.

      <section id="common-features-dbms">
        <h3>Common Features of Commercial DBMS's</h3>
        <h4>CRUD Operations</h4>
        <p>
          The basic operations DBMS provides are represented by the CRUD
          acronym:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>C</strong> - Creating Data</li>
          <li><strong>R</strong> - Retrieving Data</li>
          <li><strong>U</strong> - Updating Data</li>
          <li><strong>D</strong> - Deleting Data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These basic operations are common to DBMS's. Other features that are
          commonly implemented in commercial DBMS's aim to solve the issues
          outlined in the previous section.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Access Tools</h4>
        <p>
          Data access tools make the process of data retrieval more efficient.
          Users of data do not require a technical background as data access
          tools have simple user-interfaces with no tech experience required to
          retrieve data. Users are able to query, view, and manipulate data in a
          database to facilitate insight generation and a faster route to
          decision-making.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Recovery</h4>
        <p>
          DBMS's also improve data recovery allowing users to access older
          versions of existing data. In the event of loss or failures in the
          data, data recovery tools make the restoration process much faster
          allowing for continuity in operations. Without this feature, the
          rebound time would be longer and more resources would need to be
          allocated to the data recovery process making operations less
          efficient.
        </p>

        <h4>Auditing Features</h4>
        <p>
          The ability to monitor activity within a database is the audit feature
          implemented in commercial DBMS's. Auditing features improve data
          security and protection as any changes made to data are recorded and
          access to the data is tracked. The activity led allows for
          accountability and deters malicious activity as people are aware that
          they may be detected. In the event of a security incident, the tracked
          activity provides a body of evidence.
        </p>

        <h4>Distributed Data Management</h4>
        <p>
          Distributed data management is a feature that allows data to be shared
          between multiple users, and across multiple systems or locations. When
          data is shared among multiple users and systems, distributed data
          management features ensure that data is synchronised, accessible in
          good time and available for use for multiple users and locations. This
          feature improves the efficiency of access to data within databases
          while maintaining data security and data integrity.
        </p>

        <h4>Backup Features</h4>
        <p>
          Backup features are commonly implemented in commercial DBMS's to
          prevent data loss. Similar to data recovery features, backup features
          allow users to restore data in the event of loss or damage. In
          contrast to data recovery features, backup features tend to refer to
          copies of the entire database usually stored remotely (e.g., cloud
          storage). Backup features automate the backup process which may have
          been tedious before DBMS. The backup feature also lowers the risk of
          human error affecting the integrity or completeness of a backup.
        </p>

        <h4>Transaction Processing</h4>
        <p>
          Transaction processing features refer to the features that ensure
          database transactions are processed reliably before data is
          permanently created, updated, and deleted within the database. These
          features include alerts for users about invalid or incomplete data
          inputs preventing erroneous changes to the data within the database.
          These features contribute to data integrity as errors/issues are
          detected and can be corrected before they are committed. When the
          consequences of inaccurate data are grave, this feature is salient as
          small inaccuracies may distort findings leading to poor
          decision-making and outcomes. In addition, transaction processing
          features include features that prevent data redundancies as one is
          able to update a field across multiple files or records ensuring
          consistency within the database.

        <h3>Understanding Sparse Data</h3>
        <p>
          Sparse data refers to datasets where most fields have values of zero
          or are empty. The meaning of sparse data is different from missing
          data although the value of both may be zero or empty. Unlike missing
          data, sparse data has a zero or empty value that is known, whereas
          missing data has a null value because the value is not yet known.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sparse data is commonly found in recommender systems for TV and movie
          streaming services. Users and their recommendations can be represented
          by a user-item matrix. The rows are the user values and the columns
          represent the items (TV shows and movies) available on the platform.
          Given that users view a small subset of all items available for
          streaming and recommend a smaller subset of items, the resultant
          matrix would likely be sparse data as most values would be null or
          zero (i.e., the shows that the user has not recommended or watched).
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>The Different Types of DBMS's</h3>

        <h4>Hierarchical</h4>
        <p>
          This type of DBMS uses a tree-like structure or hierarchy to model
          data. Hierarchical DBMS stores data according to its record type such
          that a record type is required to have a single parent record type,
          with the root node being the exception. A record instance follows the
          data structure/description pre-determined by its attributes and the
          attributes it inherits from its parent. An XML document is a good
          example of a hierarchical DBMS. Hierarchical DBMS's are best for
          systems that have a clear hierarchical structure, such as a file
          system or directory, as the database is traversed from the root to the
          "leaf" i.e., from the root directory through subfolders containing
          files. The IBM Information Management System (IMS) DB is an example of
          a hierarchical model and it can be used to store records such as
          customer information with fields like customer name and contact
          information. The children of this record may be customer orders that
          inherit the customer details to reduce redundancy.
        </p>

        <h4>Relational</h4>
        <p>
          This DBMS represents data as relations or tables. Each row is a record
          and the fields/attributes are represented in columns. This DBMS type
          is useful for representing relationships between records. Relational
          DBMS would be used for inventory and stock management in business
          operations as it allows for the relations between multiple record
          types to be represented e.g., inventory levels, orders, supplier
          information, receivables and payables can all be represented and
          queried. MySQL is an example of a popular relational DBMS.
        </p>

        <h4>Network</h4>
        <p>
          A network DBMS uses a network model to organise data. Similar to the
          hierarchical model, a record type has a parent node, however, record
          instances can have multiple parents and child nodes, allowing for more
          complex relationships within the database. The ability to have
          many-to-many relationships between records makes this database model
          more flexible than hierarchical DBMS, however, traversing the network
          model is also more complex. Network DBMS can be used for
          telecommunications where a single switch can connect to multiple
          networks and a single network can be connected to many switches.
          RaimaDB is a good example of a commercially available DBMS that uses
          the network model. Data from multiple sensors and operating systems
          can be stored and manipulated efficiently and reliably allowing for
          process optimisation through real-time feedback loops from multiple
          inputs in an Internet of Things environment.
        </p>

        <h4>Object-Oriented</h4>
        <p>
          Object-oriented DBMS add database functionality to object-oriented
          programming languages such as Java. The objective of this DBMS type
          was to ensure that the database and the program spoke the same
          language. In this model, data is stored as objects and methods used to
          manipulate the data are stored with it much like classes in
          object-oriented programming languages. This DBMS also supports
          inheritance, ultimately reducing redundancy. Object-oriented DBMS are
          used for multimedia and content management as these database types
          allow for diverse data e.g., sound, video, text, graphics, and graphs.
          ObjectDB is an example of an Object-Oriented DBMS that is optimised
          for Java.

        <h3>NoSQL Database Management Systems Features</h3>
        <p>
          NoSQL databases are suited for a variety of data models such as
          documents, key-values, wide-column, and graphs. These databases allow
          the use of semi-structured or unstructured data making them flexible
          to changes in the data over time. NoSQL databases are widely used for
          big data and web applications as they offer scalability and
          performance although this is at the expense of strict compliance to
          ACID properties.
        </p>

        <h4>Cassandra</h4>
        <p>
          Cassandra is a wide-column database model meaning that data is
          organised in rows and columns although these tables are not the same
          as relations in the relational model.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Scalability:</strong> Cassandra structures data into
            clusters of nodes where each node carries the same salience. Storage
            capacity is proportional to the number of nodes therefore adding
            more nodes increases the database system's capacity. This makes
            Cassandra well-suited for big data and real-time web data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prevention of data loss:</strong> Because of the structure
            of Cassandra, there is no single point of failure. Data is
            replicated across a number of nodes meaning a single node's failure
            does not result in data loss as replicas exist in other nodes. This
            ensures reliability and security with little to no downtime as
            alternate nodes can undertake the transactions of the malfunctioning
            node while it is restored. While this feature prevents data-loss,
            having multiple replicas of the same information affects performance
            which is why Cassandra has known latency issues and Java Memory
            Model issues.

            <strong>Cassandra Query Language (CQL):</strong> The query language
            used for Cassandra is very similar to Standard Query Language (SQL),
            making this DBMS user-friendly as SQL skills are transferable.
            Although there are similarities, Cassandra is not a relational
            database therefore there is inflexibility in the operations that can
            be performed with structured databases and SQL.

        <h4>MongoDB</h4>
        <p>
          MongoDB is an open-source database with a document-oriented
          architecture using collections and documents in lieu of relational
          tables and rows. MongoDB uses the JSON storage format making it
          possible to manipulate and view different data types in a single
          document.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Document-oriented model:</strong> MongoDB uses a
            document-based data model. This means that complex relationships can
            be represented without the rigidity of relational relationships that
            have to be represented in tables like in SQL databases. Furthermore,
            multiple types of data can exist within a document allowing
            programmers to focus on a particular data set without the need to
            traverse columns or rows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Schema-less database:</strong> Documents are grouped into
            collections and these documents do not have to have the same schema
            allowing fields to be added and deleted as the data evolves. This
            feature makes MongoDB more flexible than relational databases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Indexing:</strong> The fields within a document have a
            primary and a secondary index used to facilitate searches. This
            indexing feature allows MongoDB to sort through data efficiently to
            return an entry, instead of searching each document. This feature
            makes MongoDB competitive.

        <h4>Redis</h4>
        <p>
          Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) is a NoSQL open-source database that
          stores data in-memory. Redis supports multiple data structures making
          it versatile for users.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>RAM storage:</strong> Redis stores data in-memory function
            like an application cache. This allows the database to return
            results extremely fast independent of traffic. Data can be stored
            remotely by pushing commands to the cloud allowing data to be
            preserved after restarts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Persistence:</strong> While Redis is an in-memory data
            store, it uses persistent disk storage and regularly takes snapshots
            of datasets in their state appending changes to the data set,
            generating backups. These backups can be set to occur at
            user-defined intervals and each backup is accessible allowing one to
            restore datasets to a particular version.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Redis queues:</strong> Redis allows users to queue tasks
            allowing complex tasks to be executed autonomously or in the
            background.
          </li>

        <h3>Understanding ACID Properties of Databases</h3>
        <p>
          ACID properties describe how transactions are handled in DBMSs. ACID
          is an acronym for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability,
          all of which should be guaranteed for transactions on a single record.
          A transaction is a collection of operations that are grouped as one
          logical operation carried out on a single record or multiple records.
          Furthermore, an ACID transaction, a transaction that has all four ACID
          properties, ensures that a database maintains accuracy and integrity
          even in the event of an operation's failure.
        </p>

        <h4>Key ACID Properties</h4>
        <dl>
          <dt>Atomicity</dt>
          <dd>
            This property ensures that all the operations that make up a
            transaction are treated as a single logical operation such that a
            failure of a single operation is a failure of all the operations in
            the transaction. In order to succeed all operations must be
            successful otherwise the database is rolled back to its initial
            state before the attempted transaction.
          </dd>
          <dt>Consistency</dt>
          <dd>
            Consistency ensures that all constraints that apply to the data are
            adhered to before, during, and after the transaction. For example,
            numeric data may be constrained to positive values only. Should an
            operation result in a negative value, the transaction will not be
            successful as the constraints were not adhered to and the database
            would not be consistent. Consistency applies to the constraints
            applied to the data by the person who created the database and this
            type of consistency is also called referential integrity.
          </dd>
          <dt>Isolation</dt>
          <dd>
            Isolation refers to operations that run concurrently without
            interfering with each other. This means that operations run
            independently, even if these transactions act upon the same record,
            without interfering with each other.
          </dd>
          <dt>Durability</dt>
          <dd>
            This property ensures that the changes made to a database through
            successful transactions are persistent and these changes are saved
            to the disk even in the event of a power outage or system failure.
            Durability does not include damage to the disk however backups can
            be used to protect against data loss.
          </dd>
        </dl>
